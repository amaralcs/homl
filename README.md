My notes and exercise solutions from Hands-on ML with SkLearn, Keras and TF by Aurelien Geron

Each notebook is labelled as follows: chapterNumber_chapterName

There are two folders omitted form this repo: datasets and saved_models. The first contains downloaded and used whereas the second contains .joblib files with various models trained while I worked on the notebooks.
I decided to save them and re-load them when going back to a notebook to save time and avoid re-creating expensive models.

Execise solutions are found at the end of the notebooks.
